Title     : Hand Written Digit Prediction - Classification analysis
Objective : In this project, we will employ machine learning to forecast handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Our objective is to construct a model that 				 
            accurately predicts the digit corresponding to a given handwritten image.
